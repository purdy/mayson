# Mayson's First Lando setup

This is a very simple and *very* insecure web application setup to demonstrate Lando and how it works.

Basically, first step is to clone this repo.

Then make sure you have Lando installed.

Then cd into this repo and type `lando start`. After it's done, you can then go to the website: https://mayson.lndo.site
